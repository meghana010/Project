    <h1>What is actually E-Adoption</h1>
    <p>Parenthood is not less than a blessing especially for those who are deprived of this beautiful feeling. We are working on the slogan of “ May everyone has a child and every child has parents”. Because parenthood requires only affection, not DNA.

        Our aim is to provide information about All the children in need in different orphanages at one place to make your efforts to be a parent easier to help the child in need through our E-adoption process.  We are not an agency, nor do we provide any legal or official support for adoption. Information provided at our website is collected manually by our team from different Resources. We are not responsible for any kind of error in the information provided by us.</p>
    
        <p> E-adoption is a type of adoption where a person or a family supports a child in need by providing financial and emotional assistance. This assistance can go towards the child's education, healthcare, housing, and other needs.

            The child remains living with their biological family or in a foster care facility, and the adoptive family usually receives updates on the child's progress and well-being. Virtual adoption is a way for families who cannot adopt in the traditional sense to still make a difference in the life of a child in need.
            
            While virtual adoption can have positive effects on children's lives, it should not be confused with formal adoption. Virtual adoption does not grant legal custody or guardianship, nor does it provide the same level of stability and permanency for the child.</p>
